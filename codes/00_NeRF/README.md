A simple implementation of the paper [NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08934).
We implemented this method for 2D image synthesis and 3D view synthesis. You can find the code and results in [2D NeRF](NeRF2D.ipynb) and [3D NeRF](NeRF.ipynb).
